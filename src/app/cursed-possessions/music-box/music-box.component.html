  <h1>Music Box</h1>
  <p>When picked up, the music box will open (this does not mean that it has been activated). The music box can then be
    activated by using the primary use (default: right click on mouse) key. Doing so will end the setup phase early if
    it is ongoing. The music box cannot be activated during a hunt, and can only be used once.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Once activated, the music box will make the ghost sing along while remaining invisible, broadcasting its current
    location.</p>
  <br>
  <p>If the music box is within 5 metres of the ghost, it will trigger a ghost event where the ghost manifests and
    begins to walk towards the box. The music box can be handheld or placed on the floor, the latter being the only safe
    way to discard the box without triggering a cursed hunt before the ghost event. In all cases, the box will close
    once it stops playing.</p>
  <br>
  <p>A cursed hunt will occur when:</p>
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li>The ghost is within a short distance of the player holding the box.</li>
    <li>The ghost walks during the box-triggered ghost event for more than 5 seconds.</li>
    <li>The box is thrown while the tune is playing.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <p>A normal hunt will occur when:</p>
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li>The player reaches or is already at 0% sanity.</li>
    <li>The ghost initiates a hunt on its own.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <p>Being within 2.5 metres of an actively functioning music box drains the player's sanity at a rate of 2.5%/s,
    totaling approximately 75% if the entire song is listened to. This applies to all players within the range,
    regardless of who activated the music box.</p>
