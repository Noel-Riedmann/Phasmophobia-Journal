  <h1>Cursed Hunt</h1>
  <p>Cursed hunts can only be initiated directly by using cursed possessions. Cursed hunts always ignore the hunt sanity
    thresholds and cooldown between hunts; a cursed hunt can start immediately after a normal one, but a normal hunt
    respects the cooldown after a previous cursed hunt ends. If a cursed hunt is cancelled prematurely due to no one
    being inside, the cancelled cursed hunt will not count towards the cooldown timer.</p>
