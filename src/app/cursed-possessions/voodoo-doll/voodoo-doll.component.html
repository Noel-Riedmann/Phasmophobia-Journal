  <h1>Voodoo Doll</h1>
  <p>Interacting with the voodoo doll will cause one of the 10 pins stuck in the doll to be pushed into it at random.
    This will cause the ghost to perform an interaction, and will drop the user's sanity by 5%. These forced
    interactions can include evidence sources past EMF Level 5, such as making the ghost interact with Ghost Writing
    Books, create silhouettes in D.O.T.S. Projectors, and touch doors, windows, and light switches for Fingerprints.</p>
  <br>
  <p>If the heart pin is pressed down the user's sanity will drain by 10%, and the ghost will initiate a
    <a routerLink='/cursed-possessions/cursed-hunt'>cursed hunt</a>. If
    the user's sanity is less than the amount that the pressed pin would drain, all remaining pins will be pushed in and
    a <a routerLink='/cursed-possessions/cursed-hunt'>cursed hunt</a> will occur.
