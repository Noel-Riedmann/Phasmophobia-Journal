  <h1>Haunted-Mirror</h1>
  <p>The mirror can be toggled (default: right click on mouse) while inside the investigation area. When activated, the
    haunted mirror will show a view of a part of the favourite room as a sweeping panorama, allowing players to locate
    the room by cross-reference. This view is a live feed of the room, so any lights turned on, items moved, and
    equipment or players present in the room will be visible. The only exception is the player's own model.</p>
  <br>
  <p>Each usage of the haunted mirror drains sanity at a rate of 7.5%/s, or 20% per use, whichever is higher. This means
    that using the mirror for less than ~2.67 seconds will still drain at least 20% sanity. This includes the animation
    of raising, but not lowering, the mirror. If the user's sanity reaches zero, the mirror will crack visually and
    audibly, and the ghost will start a <a routerLink='/cursed-possessions/cursed-hunt'>cursed hunt</a> from its current
    position. The mirror will lower and cannot be used again.</p>
