  <h1>Ouija Board</h1>
  <p>A Ouija Board can be picked up with an empty hand. Swapping to another item will cause the Ouija Board to drop from
    the inventory.</p>
  <br>
  <p>The Ouija Board can be activated by left clicking (default: left click on mouse) on it if the player is not holding
    it.</p>
  <p>
    The planchette will drop down onto the board, signifying that the board has been activated. This will also cancel
    the setup phase if it is ongoing.
  </p>
  <br>
  <p>Players can choose to either use voice chat or a text-based UI to ask questions:</p>
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li>If using voice chat, once activated, the Ouija Board will respond to voice input within 5 metres of it.</li>
    <li>If using the text-based UI, the UI will appear upon activation.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <p>If the question is recognised, the planchette will move to answer the question</p>
  <br>
  <p>To deactivate the Ouija Board, any nearby player must say "Goodbye", which will make the planchette disappear.</p>
  <br>
  <p>The Ouija Board will break if any of the following occurs:</p>
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li>There is no player within 5 metres of a still-active board.</li>
    <li>The player currently asking questions has less sanity than required to "pay" for the question.</li>
    <li>The player saying goodbye has no sanity left.</li>
    <li>A specific question has been asked which will break it.</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <p>The board will burn and break itself up, initiating a <a routerLink='/cursed-possessions/cursed-hunt'>cursed hunt</a> if any player is inside the building.</p>
