  <h1>Monkey Paw</h1>
  <p>The Monkey Paw grants up to a certain number of wishes depending on the difficulty reward multiplier:</p>
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li>0x - 1.99x: 5 wishes</li>
    <li>2x - 2.99x: 4 wishes</li>
    <li>3x or higher: 3 wishes</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <p>Upon entering the investigation area, the Monkey Paw's fingers will twitch, indicating it is ready to recieve a
    prompt, and players can choose to either use voice chat or a text-based UI to make wishes.</p>
  <br>
  <ul>
    <li>If using voice chat, the Monkey Paw will listen to any player granting a wish.</li>
    <li>If using the text-based UI, the UI will appear upon activation (default: right click on mouse).</li>
  </ul>
  <br>
  <p>Most wishes can be found on tags scattered in Sunny Meadows. Picking a tag up (except for weather and anything
    wishes) will record the wish in the journal. There is no need to find the wishes to use the Monkey Paw. Each wish
    can only be used once per contract.</p>
